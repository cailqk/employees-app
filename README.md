I have devided the project in several folders.
In the components folder, there are separate folders for each entity I have used, plus a Core folder. In it, I keep the Home and Navbar components. I have made a requests folder, where I keep the logic for the requests to the backend.

The idea of the the department extension is so you can group the employees to departments of your choice and you can see the statistic for each department's employees, on the home screen.

## Technologies

-ReactJS
-Bootstrap
-json-server for the Backend
